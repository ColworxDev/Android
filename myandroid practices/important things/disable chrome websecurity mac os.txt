Yep. For Mac, open Terminal and run:

$ open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security
Also if you're trying to access local files for dev purposes like AJAX or JSON, you can use this flag too.

-â€“allow-file-access-from-files
For PC go into the command prompt and go into the folder where Chrome.exe is and type

chrome.exe --disable-web-security
That should disable the same origin policy and allow you to access local files.
